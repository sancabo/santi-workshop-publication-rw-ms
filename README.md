# Publication Service
A Single database read-write service. Exposes a CRUD api on an example resource called Publication.
A Publication is meant to represent a text user post on a social media.

This service is expected to hit a scalability limit. This is intended.

You can check my repo ``santi-workshop-publication-read-ms-`` to se a version that uses CQRS to improve searches.
